# Solving partial differential equations & Eigenvalue Problems with neural networks
This project is divided into two parts where the first part is about solving partial differential equations using Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolsen and a Neural Network. The second part is about finding eigenvalues using a neural network.


## Code skeleton
- functions
  - NN_Eigenvalue_solver.py (this is where all of the functions are)
  - PDE_solver.py

  - project3_report.pdf
- main.py 
- nn_eigenvalue.ipynb
- solving_PDE.ipynb

## Jupyter notebooks
Since this project is divided into two parts, there are two jupyter notebooks which gives you an overview and our results (with a standard deviation and random samples that changes every run), and how we got them. The name of them are 
- solving_PDE.ipynb. This file finds solution to the PDEs.
- nn_eigenvalue.ipynb. This file finds eigenvalues for given matrices using neural network.


## How to run the files 
The required packages included to run the jupyter notebooks are 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- mpl_toolkits
- sklearn
- tqdm
- jupyter notebook

Fork this repository, enter the jupyter notebooks, and run all the cells in one run. You can also run main.py, where there is small summary of the jupyter notebooks.
