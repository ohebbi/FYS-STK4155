# Franke's function and Terrain data using five-fold cross validation
This project is divided into two parts. The first part is modeling Franke's function, while the second part is modeling some given terrain data from Norway. Thus, there are two jupyter notebooks which gives you an overview and our results (with a standard deviation that changes every run), and how we got them. The name of them are \
- main.py. This file models Franke's Function.\
- main_terrain.py. This file models the terrain data.\

All of our functions can be found in the file
-functions.py

## How to run the files 
The required packages included to run the jupyter notebooks are \
- numpy
- matplotlib
- imageio
- sklearn
- mpl_toolkits
- tqdm
- jupyter notebook
- seaborn
- pandas

Do a git pull, enter the jupyter notebooks, and run all the cells in one run.
