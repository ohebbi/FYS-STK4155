# FYS-STK4155
This is the public repository for the master-subject FYS-STK4155 at the University of Oslo. It is the product of the collaboration between Mohamed Ismail, Jens Due and Oliver Hebnes. The subject consists of three main projects, where you will find more information resting within each repository. 

# Project 1
This project contains code, jupyter notebooks and a report that analyse three different regression type together with resampling method on two different data sets.

# Project 2 
## Neural network and logistic regression: Model of Franke's function and the Wisconsin breast cancer data.

This project is divided into two parts. The first part is modeling Franke's function, while the second part is about classifying the breast cancer data.

# Project 3 

## Solving partial differential equations & Eigenvalue Problems with neural networks

This project is divided into two parts where the first part is about solving partial differential equations using Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolsen and a Neural Network. The second part is about finding eigenvalues using a neural network.
