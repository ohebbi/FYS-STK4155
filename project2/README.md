# Neural network and logistic regression: Model of Franke's function and the Wisconsin breast cancer data.
This project is divided into two parts. The first part is modeling Franke's function, while the second part is about classifying the breast cancer data. 

## Code skeleton
- functions
  - functions.py (this is where all of the functions are)
  - hiddenlayer.py
  - neuralnetwork.py
- plots
  - classification

  - regression

  - project1_report.pdf
- main.py 
- main_classification.ipynb
- main_regression.ipynb

## Jupyter notebooks
Since this project is divided into two parts, there are two jupyter notebooks which gives you an overview and our results (with a standard deviation and random samples that changes every run), and how we got them. The name of them are 
- main_classification.ipynb. This file models the Wisconsin's breast cancer data.
- main_regression.ipynb. This file models Franke's Function.


## How to run the files 
The required packages included to run the jupyter notebooks are 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- tqdm
- jupyter notebook
- seaborn
- pandas

Fork this repository, enter the jupyter notebooks, and run all the cells in one run. You can also run main.py, where there is small summary of the jupyter notebooks.
